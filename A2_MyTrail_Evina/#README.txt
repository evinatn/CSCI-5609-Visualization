# README for Processing Sketch

Name: Evina Novi Thekkudan

## Part A: Got it!
In Part A, I successfully downloaded height data from Earth Explorer and converted it into a format that Processing can handle. I then calculated a histogram of heights and saved it in the model. I also drew the histogram in the Histogram View, along with the colormap.  

## Part B: Got it!
In Part B, I defined a trail on the 2D SRTM visualization and represented it with connected points. Drew a chart that shows the elevation over distance. Drew the 3D path in the 3D Spatial View as well.

## Part C: Got it!
Added images taken while hiking to the map. These images are displayed when hovering over points of interest.
