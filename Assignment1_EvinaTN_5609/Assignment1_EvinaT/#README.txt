# README for Processing Sketch

## Part A: Got it!
I successfully implemented the visualization, but names overlap when zoomed out. 

## Part B: 
I successfully visualized the area and 2010 population data using varying circle sizes and a color map. Also added a red stroke which gets highlighted when you hover over a circle and displays the population and area of that community. However, attempts to visualize the change in population over the years did not run well, so the change in population over the years is not visualized in the current version.

## Part C: Got it!
I successfully implemented the legend for the color map. 
Note:For the population legend, I used circles instead of rectangles or bars as the alignment of rectangles/bars was problematic.
